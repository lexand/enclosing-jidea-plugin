Enclosing Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
==================================

Previously I was working with NetBeans IDE. And it has very simple very useful behavior in editor:

You just select some portion of text and press one of predefined character **"** **(** **{** **[** **'** **`** and your
selection will be enclosed with typed character.

* Plugin does not work in "Column selection mode".
* Compatible with other JetBrains products
